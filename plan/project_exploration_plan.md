# Project Exploration Plan

## Objective
To gain a deeper understanding of the project structure, key components, data flow, and deployment procedures.

## Checklist

### Phase 1: Initial Project Structure Analysis
- [x] List all files and directories recursively to understand the overall layout.
- [ ] Identify and review main configuration files:
    - [ ] `package.json` (dependencies, scripts)
    - [ ] `astro.config.mjs` (Astro configuration)
    - [ ] `tailwind.config.mjs` (Tailwind CSS configuration)
    - [ ] `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript configuration)
- [ ] Examine the `public` directory for static assets.

### Phase 2: Codebase Deep Dive
- [ ] List code definitions in `src/components` to understand reusable UI elements.
- [ ] List code definitions in `src/pages` to understand page-level components and routing.
- [ ] Read relevant component files (e.g., card components) to understand their implementation and props.
- [ ] Analyze data fetching mechanisms (if any) by reviewing relevant files.
- [ ] Investigate state management patterns (if any).

### Phase 3: Deployment and SEO Analysis
- [ ] Review deployment scripts (e.g., `scripts/deploy.sh`) to understand the deployment process.
- [ ] Examine SEO-related files (e.g., `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, `src/components/SEO.astro`) for meta tags and structured data.

### Phase 4: Summary and Recommendations
- [ ] Summarize findings on project structure, key components, and data flow.
- [ ] Document deployment process and SEO implementation.
- [ ] Propose potential areas for improvement, refactoring, or new features based on the analysis.
