# Coders in Flow: Comprehensive Feature List

*The most advanced AI coding assistant for VSCode - Truly multi-tasking, mobile-enabled, and enterprise-ready*

## 🌟 Revolutionary Features (Industry Exclusives)

### 1. **True Multi-Tasking Architecture**

- **Complete Task Isolation**: Each task maintains its own:
  - Context window and conversation history
  - AI provider and model selection
  - Token tracking and usage metrics
  - Tool permissions and restrictions
  - Mode configuration
- **Parent-Child Task Relationships**: Tasks can spawn subtasks that aggregate results
