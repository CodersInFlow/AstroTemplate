-----
Architecture Overview
Tech Stack:

Frontend: Astro with React components, TailwindCSS for styling
Backend: Go with Gorilla Mux, JWT authentication
Database: MongoDB
Deployment: Docker containers, nginx reverse proxy
Current Authentication System
User Model (backend/internal/models/user.go:10-19):

Only 2 roles: admin and user
Approval system for new registrations
JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
httpOnly cookies for web security
Authentication Flow:

Login creates JWT with userId, email, role
Token stored in httpOnly cookie
Middleware validates on each request
Role-based access control (admin/user)
Design Customization Points
Primary Styling Hooks:

Global CSS (src/styles/global.css) - Tailwind base
Tailwind Config (tailwind.config.js) - Extend theme here
Layout Component (src/layouts/Layout.astro) - Meta tags, global imports
Component Styling - Each component uses Tailwind classes
Color Scheme - Currently gray-900/800 backgrounds, indigo-400 accents
Key Components to Modify:

HeroSection.astro - Main landing hero
HeaderSimple.astro - Navigation
Footer.astro - Footer design
Section components in src/components/sections/
Multi-Level Account Implementation Strategy
Current Limitations:

Only 2 roles (admin/user)
No granular permissions
No API key system for mobile apps
No rate limiting or API-specific auth
Recommended Enhancements:

Expand User Roles in backend/internal/models/user.go:

superadmin - Full system access
admin - Blog/content management
editor - Create/edit own posts
subscriber - Read-only, authenticated access
api_user - API-only access for mobile apps
Add Permissions Field:

go
Copy
Permissions []string `bson:"permissions" json:"permissions"`
API Authentication for Mobile:

Add API key generation system
Create separate auth endpoint for mobile
Implement refresh tokens
Add rate limiting middleware
Database Schema Updates:

Add api_keys collection for mobile auth
Add permissions array to users
Add last_login, device_info fields
Implementation Path for Mobile API Support
Create API Key System:

Generate unique API keys per user
Store hashed in database
Separate auth middleware for API routes
Mobile-Specific Endpoints:

/api/mobile/auth/login - Returns longer-lived tokens
/api/mobile/auth/refresh - Token refresh endpoint
/api/mobile/content/* - Read-only content access
Security Enhancements:

CORS configuration for mobile domains
Rate limiting per API key
Request signing for sensitive operations
Design Modification Strategy
Quick Theme Changes:

Modify tailwind.config.js to add custom colors
Update global.css for base styles
Component-level class updates
Major Design Overhaul:

Create new component variants
Use Astro's slot system for layouts
Leverage React components for interactivity
CSS modules for component isolation
The system is well-architected for expansion. The clean separation between frontend/backend and use of JWT makes adding mobile support straightforward. The MongoDB schema is flexible enough to accommodate new user levels and permissions without major refactoring.

Can you put all that information in the README.md, so basically the enhancements are fine, but we need a few things, the ability for one user to have mutiple boat lifts under their account, so we jneed a boat lift table, and in that table we need to store some sort of key system, where the lift has a key and uses it to encode something to authenticate to the server.. the lift and the server need to be able to authenticate each other, with a mobile app in the middle. the mobile app could need to not be aware, because anyone can install the app and connect to tghe boat lift and request access, then the boat lift with respond to the app, and the app will forward the request back to the server, then the server needs to authenticate and send a response the lift knows is valid, do you know whatg i mean? Also the users need to be able to givbe other people access to their lifts as either an admin or a guest user which will have an expiration time, so like if someopne is staying at your house you can authenticate them with an key tghat you can email them, and the user can use this key to set up their access. do you understand what i mean?
